--- Assignments ---
- Assigning undeclared variable gives error.
- Assignment RHS must be the same type as assignment LHS.
- Variables can be assigned to themselves.


--- Assignments(Subscript) ---
- Assignment RHS must be same type as vector/matrix element type.
- Subscript must have the right number of indexes.
- Subscript must not be out of bounds.
- Subscript does not work on non-vectors and non-matrices.


--- Declarations ---
- Declarations must be initialized.
- Declaration initialization(RHS) must be of same type as LHS.
- Matrix with different row lengths.
- Matrix declaration supports all types.
- Matrix declaration with different types gives error.
- Matrix with one element.
- Vector declaration supports all types.
- Vector declaration with different types gives error.
- Vector with one element.
- Number only accepts variables declared as number or number literals.


--- Expressions(Matrices) ---



--- Expressions(Numbers) ---



--- Expressions(Vectors) ---
- Only accepts vectors of same size and with the element-type "number".
- Accepts scalar-vector multiplication [NOT YET]
[TODO] Cannot assign expressions to vectors(possibly matrices too) in any other form than <1,2,3,...>;

--- Printing ---
- Only accepts references to numbers.
- Can concatenate.
- Accepts both text and numbers .
- Accepts subscripting references.


--- Reference(Subscript) ---
- Represents element type and is type checked according to that.
- Works for both matrices and vectors.
- Subscript must not be out of bounds.
- Subscript must have the right number of indexes.
