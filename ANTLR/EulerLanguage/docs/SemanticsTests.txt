----- TODO -----
- Move all error-messages into ErrorVisitor
- Optimize symbol table id's
- Specify error message for incompatible vector/matrix types. I.E. why they are incompatible.
- Must not divide by 0


----- TESTS -----
--- Assignments ---
- Assigning undeclared variable gives error.
- Assignment RHS must be the same type as assignment LHS.
- Variables can be assigned to themselves.


--- Assignments(Subscript) ---
- Assignment RHS must be same type as vector/matrix element type.
- Subscript must have the correct number of indexes.
- Subscript must not be out of bounds.
- Subscript does not work on non-vectors and non-matrices.


--- Declarations ---
- Declarations must be initialized.
- Declaration initialization(RHS) must be of same type as LHS.
- Matrix with different row lengths.
- Matrix declaration supports all types.
- Matrix declaration with different types gives error.
- Matrix with one element.
- Vector declaration supports all types.
- Vector declaration with different types gives error.
- Vector with one element.
- Number only accepts variables declared as number or number literals.


--- Expressions(Matrices) ---
- Matrix addition and subtraction only accepts matrices of equal sizes.
- Matrix multiplication accepts only matrices for which matrix ones number of columns is equal to matrix twos number of rows.
- Matrix multiplication produces a matrix that is equal to matrix ones number of rows and matrix twos number of columns.


--- Expressions(Numbers) ---
- Addition, division, modulo, multiplication and subtraction only accepts number-types
  (unless its scalar-vector/matrix multiplication, in which case it would return either a vector or a matrix).
- Works with number-literals and references.


--- Expressions(Vectors) ---
- Only accepts vectors of same size and with the element-type "number" for vector-vector operations
- Accepts scalar-vector multiplication ( returns a vector type)
- Vector-vector addition, subtraction and multiplication only accepts vector of equal lengths


--- Expression (Matrix-vector and vector-matrix) ---
- Vector-matrix multiplication accepts only compatible vectors and matrices (vector length must be equal to matrix row number)
- Matrix-vector multiplication only accepts compatible vectors and matrices (vector length must be equal to matrix column number)


--- Iteration statements ---
- Checks for correct boolean expression
- Can have an empty body


--- Printing ---
- Only accepts references to numbers.
- Can concatenate.
- Accepts both text and numbers .
- Accepts subscripting references.


--- Reference(Subscript) ---
- Represents element type and is type checked according to that.
- Works for both matrices and vectors.
- Subscript must not be out of bounds.
- Subscript must have the correct number of indexes.


--- Selection statements ---
- Works for all (allowed) logical operators
- Checks for boolean expressions for conditions and reports an error otherwise
- Can have an empty body
- Produces else-if chains with condition checking
